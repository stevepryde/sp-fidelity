# sp-fidelity-wgpu

The wgpu backend of the [`sp-fidelity`](https://github.com/stevepryde/sp-fidelity/blob/main/crates/sp-fidelity/README.md) port: an
implementation of the SDK's `FfxInterface`, as AMD's DX12 and Vulkan backends
are. It knows nothing about any renderer or game.

Resources and pipelines come from the SDK's descriptions and shader blobs:
layouts from each blob's binding tables, binding types reflected from the
port's WGSL for that blob. Compute (direct and indirect), copy and clear jobs
are recorded into the caller's `wgpu::CommandEncoder`.

## Use

Create the device with `required_features()` (and `optional_features()` for the
FP16 permutations), then get the interface and hand it to an effect context as
the SDK's samples do:

```rust
let (backend, interface) = sp_fidelity_wgpu::ffx_get_interface_wgpu(&device);
// Each frame, before the effect's dispatch:
let command_list = backend.borrow_mut().ffx_get_command_list_wgpu(encoder);
let color = backend.borrow_mut().ffx_get_resource_wgpu(&texture, "Color", FFX_RESOURCE_STATE_COMPUTE_READ);
// … dispatch with command_list and the resources, then:
let encoder = backend.borrow_mut().ffx_take_command_list_wgpu(command_list).unwrap();
queue.submit([encoder.finish()]);
```

`FfxCommandList` is the SDK's `void*`. `ffx_get_command_list_wgpu` (the analogue
of `ffxGetCommandListDX12`) moves the caller's encoder into the backend and
returns its handle; `ffx_take_command_list_wgpu` hands it back with the jobs
recorded. A caller that records into a shared frame encoder can swap in a new
encoder (`std::mem::replace`) and submit the command buffers in order.

`ffx_get_resource_wgpu` (the analogue of `ffxGetResourceDX12`) describes a
texture with `ffx_get_resource_description_wgpu`; the handle stays valid until
the next `ffx_take_command_list_wgpu`. Each pass views a texture as its binding
declares. A copy destination needs `COPY_DST` and a copy source `COPY_SRC`.

Each pipeline keeps the bind groups of the last two resource sets its jobs
bound (FSR2 alternates two by frame) and its own uniform buffers, into which
each job's constants are copied from one upload buffer per
`execute_gpu_jobs`. A kept group holds the textures it binds, so a caller's
texture stays allocated until its pipelines bind two other sets or the context
is destroyed.
`set_fp16_supported(false)` reports a device without FP16 so contexts created
afterwards use the FP32 permutations.

## Features

`required_features()` is derived from the FSR2 WGSL and the resources
`ffx_fsr2.cpp` creates:

| Feature | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| `SUBGROUP` | SPD's wave operations in the luminance pyramid |
| `TEXTURE_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC_FORMAT_FEATURES` | UAVs in R16G16F, R16F, R8, R8G8, R11G11B10F; read-write R8, R16F and (allocated as RGBA32F) R32G32F UAVs |
| `TEXTURE_ATOMIC` | `InterlockedMin`/`InterlockedMax` on the R32_UINT reconstructed depth (R32 integer UAVs are created with `STORAGE_ATOMIC`, without which wgpu's Metal backend performs no texture atomic) |
| `TEXTURE_FORMAT_16BIT_NORM` | the R16_SNORM Lanczos and maximum-bias lookup textures |
| `FLOAT32_FILTERABLE` | linear sampling of 32-bit float application inputs |

Clears are storage writes of the job's colour (`ClearUnorderedAccessViewFloat`),
so `CLEAR_TEXTURE` is not needed.

## Platform workarounds

Only here, never in the port:

- SDK-P10: wgpu turns an indirect dispatch above 65,535 groups into no work.
  A conversion pass writes a bounded 2D grid from the SDK's arguments and the
  pass entry point is wrapped to rebuild the SDK's logical group ID; surplus
  groups return before any barrier.
- SDK-P6: wgpu cannot force a subgroup size, so the backend reports shader
  model 6.2 and the SDK never selects a wave64 permutation.
- Metal has no read-write `Rg32Float` storage texture: an `R32G32_FLOAT` UAV
  the effect creates (FSR2's auto exposure) is an `Rgba32Float` texture, its
  initial data widened with zero `.zw`; the port reads and writes `.xy`.
- WGSL texture atomics return nothing, so the port binds FSR2's SPD counter
  (a 1x1 `R32_UINT` UAV texture in the SDK) as a one-element storage buffer.
  From the first job whose pipeline binds a texture the effect created as a
  buffer, a buffer holding the texture's contents (initial data, clears)
  replaces it; a zero clear of it clears the buffer.
- Observers see each resource's SDK description beside the object, so a
  capture can write the SDK's layout.

`set_job_observer` sees every job before and after it is recorded, with its
resources and the encoder; `readback::Readback` copies resources out. The
fidelity tests in `sp-fidelity-oracle` use both.
